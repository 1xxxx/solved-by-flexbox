    <h1>Holy Grail Layout</h1>

    <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail_(web_design)">Holy Grail Layout</a> is a classic CSS problem with various solutions presented over time. If you're unfamiliar with the history of the Holy Grail layout, this <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/holygrail">A List Apart article</a> offers a pretty good summary and links to a few of the more well-known solutions.</p>

    <p>At its core, the Holy Grail Layout is a page with a header, footer, and three columns. The center column contains the main content, and the left and right columns contain supplamental content like ads or navigation.</p>

    <p>Most CSS solutions to this problem aim to meet a few goals:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>have a fluid center with fixed-width sidebars</li>
      <li>the center column (main content) should appear first in the HTML source</li>
      <li>all columns should be the same height, regardless of which column is actually the tallest</li>
      <li>require minimal markup</li>
      <li>have the footer "stick" to the bottom of the page if there's not enough content</li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, because of the nature of these goals and the original limitations of CSS, none of the classic solutions to this problem were ever able to meet all of them.</p>

    <p>With Flexbox, however, a solution that meets all of these goals is trivial.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-xml">&lt;body class="HolyGrail">
  &lt;header>...&lt;/header>
  &lt;div class="HolyGrail-body">
    &lt;main class="HolyGrail-content">...&lt;/main>
    &lt;nav class="HolyGrail-leftSidebar">...&lt;/nav>
    &lt;aside class="HolyGrail-rightSidebar">...&lt;/aside>
  &lt;/div>
  &lt;footer>...&lt;/footer>
&lt;/body></code></pre>

  <p>Geting the center content row to stretch and the footer to stick to the bottom is solved in the same was as in the <a href="{{ '/demos/sticky-footer/' | absolute }}">Sticky Footer</a> example.The only difference in the center row (<code>.HolyGrails-body</code>) needs to be <code>display: flex</code> as well to arrange its children.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-css">.HolyGrail {
  display: flex;
  min-height: 100vh;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.HolyGrail-body {
  display: flex;
  flex: 1;
}</code></pre>

  <p>Three equal-height columns with a fluid center and fixed-width sidebars is just as easy:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-css">.HolyGrail-content {
  flex: 1;
}

.HolyGrail-leftSidebar, .HolyGrail-rightSidebar {
  /* 12em is the width of the columns */
  flex: 0 0 12em;
}

.HolyGrail-leftSidebar {
  /* put the nav on the left */
  order: -1;
}</code></pre>
